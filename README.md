# Principal-Component-Analysis
Mulitvariate data analysis on broad data, dimension reduction technique using R


## Objective we will cover in this project:

-> To understand the data and share our inference to it.  
-> Create clusters using unsupervised learning methods and compare them (hierarchical and k-means).  
-> Understanding PCA algorithm and implementing on our given data.  
-> Predicting value of alpha casin using the MIR spectra data.  
-> Creating a function which works similar to PLSR and predict.  


We can interpret from this plot that all MIR spectra data which are wavelengths ranges from 0-0.65 and they are highly collinear.
